UI based editor for developing simple puzzle games

I'm starting work on my own simple puzzle game editor based on the needs of my friend.

It will include:
 - Textures browser
 - Editor's main stage aka Canvas to display current stage
 - Stage list
 - Piece properties panel
 - Layers panel (still doubting about it)
 - Game test controls (to try out what you've built)
